### Issues Identified and Fixed:

1. **Duplicate Variable Declarations**:
   - Removed duplicate `privacyModalElement` declaration in choose-concern.js
   - Fixed modal instance creation to use single instances

2. **Modal Instance Management**:
   - Created single instances of all modals at initialization
   - Fixed `submissionDetailModal` to use the existing instance instead of creating new ones
   - Added proper error handling for modal element existence

3. **Event Handling**:
   - Enhanced visual feedback for row clicks
   - Added preventDefault and stopPropagation to ensure clean event handling
   - Improved table row styling for better clickability

4. **Modal HTML Structure**:
   - Added proper `aria-labelledby` and `aria-hidden` attributes to all modals
   - Ensured modal structure is consistent with Bootstrap 5 standards

### Key Changes Made:

1. **choose-concern.js**:
   - Fixed duplicate variable declarations
   - Improved modal instance management
   - Enhanced event handling for table row interactions
   - Cleaned up all debugging code

2. **choose-concern.html**:

### Current Status:
